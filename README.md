# Social Distancing & Health Detector
Social Distancing & Health Detector 

ECE M202A Project Proposal:

Team Member: Xuanan Yue(UID: 405629055), Chuang Yu(UID: 305629107)

# 1. Motivation:
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, most cities in the United States have made policies about social distancing(staying at least 6 feet away from others when possible). However, these policies are not strictly followed when people are not paying enough attention. For example, people tend not to remain at a safe distance with others when they are working on their cellphones, listening to music and not seeing others approaching from the back or other directions. Therefore, in order to practice this policy appropriately, our team came up with an idea of designing a device based on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense which not only has personal mode but also has possible quarantine mode when a group of users is forced to quarantine at a specific site monitored by medical personnel. 

# 2. Abstract:
The main idea of this project is to design a device based on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense that can measure the distance between the user and the person in front. To keep safe social distancing, the Arduino board is going to be connected with IR and Ultrasonic sensors, which are used to measure the distance and body temperature of the person. To make the device user-friendly, the device will be connected to the app on cellphone via Bluetooth. By sending the warnings of high body temperature and insufficient social distance, the user is able to always keep social distance and know if others show symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, the device can measure the user’s health conditions, such as heart rate, body temperature, etc.

# 3. Goals:
Measuring the distance
Measuring the body temperature of the person in front
Measuring the user’s health conditions 

Other possible features when there are a group of users at a quarantine site:
GPS module to locate the users 
Module to detect if the users takes the device off for a long time
Alarms the medical personnel if the users are too close to others for a long time
Conduct contact tracing if one of the users is tested positive
